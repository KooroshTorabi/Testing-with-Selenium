If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,7,15,"Fictions, Today's Books",,,https://oncearoundbookshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/author_03-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,0

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n</div>",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,5.99,20,"Fictions, Today's Books",,,https://oncearoundbookshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/author_19-1.jpg,,,,,,,,,0

Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City's most popular citizens--Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon have DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.\nAs the investigation expands and horrifying details begin to emerge, King's story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,10.11,10.99,"Fictions, Horror",,,https://oncearoundbookshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/9781501180996.jpg,,,,,,,,,0
